# weather-dashboard

## Description

-This application is a weather dashboard displaying current weather and also provides a 5 day forecast for different cities around the world using their latitude and longitude.

-I used HTML, CSS, Jquery, dayjs and openweathermap's api to display the weather data in the dashboard.

- I learned how to use server apis to display the data in the DOM and to use in conjunction with third party apis.

- The five day forecast,  I decided to set for 12 noon each day instead of the default 3 hours interval of openweathermap as it is in the middle of the day.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use the weather dashboard please go to https://mikewd-dev.github.io/weather-dashboard/.You can search a city using the search button or any of the buttons with the city names. The data is persistent therefore if you close the browser or refresh the the last set of data remains displayed.
